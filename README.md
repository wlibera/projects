### About "price_prediction_HPM_GWR" project

This team project was developed in collaboration with my colleagues Hassan Ali and Sahar Pourahmad. It is a comparative study of Airbnb price prediction in Amsterdam. Two geographical models are considered: the Hedonic Price Model (HPM) and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The goal was to demonstrate that spatial variation matters when it comes to pricing AirbnbÂ spaces. 

This project includes a R script *("project_final.RMD")* that handles all data and model processing. The *"listings_clean.csv"* file is required to run it. It is a cleaned data frame with all variables considered that has already been cleaned and pre-processed. Appendix 1 of *"A Comparative Study of Spatial and Non-spatial Modelling in Price Prediction.pdf"* contains a detailed list of the data sources and how they were processed. Furthermore, the *"Neighborhood.shp"* file allows us to present the spatial variation of the variables to be displayed in the Amsterdam neighbourhood map.
