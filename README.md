# Projects
This repository contains all of the projects that were a part of my Master in Applied Data Science at Utrecht University. Since the projects were made as a form of assessment for courses, the exact papers with the results are not posted. In order to see specific papers, please contact me.  

### About "price_prediction_HPM_GWR" project

This team project was developed in collaboration with my colleagues Hassan Ali and Sahar Pourahmad. It is a comparative study of Airbnb price prediction in Amsterdam. Two geographical models are considered: the Hedonic Price Model (HPM) and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR). The goal was to demonstrate that spatial variation matters when it comes to pricing AirbnbÂ spaces. 

This project includes a R script *("project_final.RMD")* that handles all data and model processing. The *"listings_clean.csv"* file is required to run it. It is a cleaned data frame with all variables considered that has already been cleaned and pre-processed. The *"Neighborhood.shp"* file allows us to present the spatial variation of the variables to be displayed in the Amsterdam neighbourhood map. 

### About "price_prediction_HPM_GWR" project

This team project was developed in collaboration with my colleagues Hassan Ali, Danya Mawed and Jelle Prins. The aim was to determine the suitable areas for wind turbines and evaluate the theoretical maximum energy production within these places. 

This project was entirely done in the QGIS program and the tools available. The workflow below shows all the steps required to achieve the final result.

The folder includes all the shape files (.shp) with all the steps and restrictions needed to achieve the final map that contains the suitable areas *("Final_Suitable_AreasV5")*.
